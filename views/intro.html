        Managing events is all about detailed preparation, time management, and problem solving. Regardless of whether
        the event is an individual speaking at a podium for thirty minutes or a multi-day festival with dozens of
        parties involved dispersed over several locations, I have the necessary talents to produce these events in a
        professional and practiced manner. My end goal is always to help ensure that the presenter(s), venue, and
        College emerge successful.
